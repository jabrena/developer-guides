An automatic confirmation email will be sent to the email address you registered In the confirmation email you receive, click on Activate your account You can now log in to the portal with your new credentials! Welcome to Amadeus for Developers ! Step 2: Get your API key To start using the APIs you need to tell the system that you are allowed to do so. This process is called authentication. Danger Remember that the API Key and API Secret are for personal use only. Do not share them with anyone. All you need to do is to attach an alphanumeric string called token to your calls. This token will identify you as a valid user and is generated from two parameters: API Key and API Secret . To get them, and once your account has been verified, you can sign in and follow these steps: Click on your username (top right corner) Go to My Self-Service Workspace Click on Create New App button Enter your application details and click on Create Important Test environment At this stage, you are using the testing environment, where you will enjoy a fixed free number of free API call quotas per month for all your applications. When you reach the limit, you will receive an error message. This environment will help you build and test your app for free and get ready for launching it to the market. Step 3: Calling the API For our first call, let's get a list of possible destinations from Paris for a maximum amount of 200 EUR using the Flight Inspiration Search API , which returns a list of destinations from a given origin along with the cheapest price for each one. Creating the Request Before making your first API call, you need to get your access token . For security purposes, we implemented the oauth2 process that will give you your access token based on your API Key and API Secret. To retrieve the token, we need to send a POST request to the following endpoint /v1/security/oauth2/token, with the correct Content-Type header and body: curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Warning Please take a look at our Authorization guide to understand how the process works in depth. According to the documentation, you need to use v1/shopping/flight-destinations as the endpoint followed by the mandatory parameter origin . As you want to filter the offers to those cheaper than 200 EUR, you need to add the maxPrice parameter as well. Our call is therefore: curl 'https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/shopping/flight-destinations?origin=PAR&maxPrice=200' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer ABCDEFGH12345' Note how we add the Authorization header to the request with the value Bearer string concatenated with the token previously requested. Evaluating the Response The response returns a JSON object containing a list of destinations matching our criteria: { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"PAR\" , \"destination\" : \"CAS\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-09-06\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-09-11\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"161.90\" } }, { \"type\" : \"flight-destination\" , \"origin\" : \"PAR\" , \"destination\" : \"AYT\" , \"departureDate\" : \"2022-10-16\" , \"returnDate\" : \"2022-10-31\" , \"price\" : { \"total\" : \"181.50\" } } ] } Congratulations!

OAuth generates an access token which grants the client permission to access a protected resource. The method to acquire a token is called grant . There are different types of OAuth grants . Amadeus for Developers uses the Client Credentials Grant . Requesting an access token Once you have created an app and received your API Key and API Secret , you can generate an access token by sending a POST request to the authorization server: https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token/ Information Remember that your API Key and API Secret should be kept private. Read more about best practices for secure API key storage . The body of the request is encoded as x-www-form-urlencoded , where the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value: Key Value grant_type The value client_credentials client_id The API Key for the application client_secret The API Secret for the application Specify the type of the request using the content-type HTTP header with the value application/x-www-form-urlencoded . The following example uses cURL to request a new token: curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/security/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}\" Note that the -X POST parameter is not needed in the cURL command. As we are sending a body, cURL sends the request as POST automatically. Response The authorization server will respond with a JSON object: { \"type\" : \"amadeusOAuth2Token\" , \"username\" : \"foo@bar.com\" , \"application_name\" : \"BetaTest_foobar\" , \"client_id\" : \"3sY9VNvXIjyJYd5mmOtOzJLuL1BzJBBp\" , \"token_type\" : \"Bearer\" , \"access_token\" : \"CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" , \"expires_in\" : 1799 , \"state\" : \"approved\" , \"scope\" : \"\" } The response will contain the following parameters: Parameter Description type The type of resource. The value will be amadeusOAuth2Token . username Your username (email address). application_name The name of your application. client_id The API Key for your application token_type The type of token issued by the authentication server. The value will be Bearer . access_token The token to authenticate your requests. expires_in The number of seconds until the token expires. state The status of your request. Values can be approved or expired . Using the token Once the token has been retrieved, you can authenticate your requests to Amadeus Self-Service APIs. Each API call must contain the authorization HTTP header with the value Bearer {access_token} , where acess_token is the token you have just retrieved. The following example is a call to the Flight Check-in Links API to retrieve the check-in URL for Iberia ( IB ): curl \"https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airline=IB\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer CpjU0sEenniHCgPDrndzOSWFk5mN\" Managing tokens from your source code To retrieve a token using your favourite programming language, send a POST request and parse the JSON response as in the cURL examples above. There are different strategies to maintain your token updated, like checking the time remaining until expiration before each API call or capturing the unauthorized error when the token expires. In both cases, you must request a new token. To simplify managing the authentication process, you can use the Amadeus for Developers SDKs available on GitHub. The SDKs automatically fetch and store the access_token and set the headers in all API calls. Example of initializing the client and authenticating with the Node SDK: var Amadeus = require ( 'amadeus' ); var amadeus = new Amadeus ({ clientId : '[API Key]' , clientSecret : '[API Secret]' }); You can then call the API.

Multi-city search is a functionality that lets you search for consecutive one-way flights between multiple destinations in a single request. The returned flights are packaged as a complete, bookable itinerary. To perform multi-city searches, you must use the POST method of Flight Offers Search API .

This is especially true if time passes between the initial search and the decision to book, as fares are limited and there are thousands of bookings occurring every minute. During this step, you can also add ancillary products like extra bags or legroom. Once a flight has been selected, you\u2019ll need to confirm the availability and price of the fare. This is where the Flight Offers Price API comes in. This API returns the final fare price (including taxes and fees) of flights from the Flight Offers Search API as well as pricing for ancillary products and the payment information that will be needed to make the final booking. The body to be sent via POST is built by a new object of type flight-offers-pricing composed by a list of flight-offers (up to 6) + payment information. { \"data\" : { \"type\" : \"flight-offers-princing\" , \"flightOffers\" : [ { \"type\" : \"flight-offer\" } ], \"payment\" : [ { Payme nt _Objec t } ] } Booking a Flight Once the fare is confirmed, you\u2019re ready to use the Flight Create Orders API to perform the actual booking. This API lets you log a reservation in the airlines\u2019 systems and create a PNR, and returns a unique ID number and the reservation details. If you\u2019re using an airline consolidator, the PNR will be automatically sent to the consolidator for ticket issuance. Visit the Flight Create Orders documentation page for more details on this API. Remember, you need to be able to issue a ticket to make bookings with our Flight Create Order API. To access the API in production, you need to either sign a contract with an airline consolidator or be accredited to issue tickets yourself. Issuing a ticket Once the booking is made, you need to complete payment. In most cases, you\u2019ll receive payment from the customer and then pay the airline, typically via an industry-specific settlement procedure like the BSP or ARC (more on those later). In the final step, a flight ticket is issued. In industry terms, a flight ticket is a confirmation that payment has been received, the reservation has been logged, and the customer has the right to enjoy the flight. For IATA member airlines , only certain accredited parties can issue tickets. In the next section, we\u2019ll go into detail about your options for managing this final step in the booking process. Common Errors Issuance not allowed in Self Service Self-Service users must work with an airline consolidator that can issue tickets on your behalf. In that case, the payment is not processed by the API but directly between you and the consolidator. Adding a form of payment into the Flight Create Orders API will be rejected by error INVALID FORMAT. Price discrepancy The price of airfare fluctuates constantly. Creating an order for a flight whose price is no longer valid at the time of booking will trigger the following error: { \"errors\" : [ { \"status\" : 400 , \"code\" : 37200 , \"title\" : \"PRICE DISCREPANCY\" , \"detail\" : \"Current grandTotal price (2780.28) is different from request one (2779.58)\" } ] } If you receive this error, reconfirm the fare price with the Flight Offers Price API before booking.","title":"Flights"},{"location":"resources/flights/#flights","text":"","title":"Flights"},{"location":"resources/flights/#how-to-search-flights","text":"","title":"How to search flights"},{"location":"resources/flights/#inspirational-search","text":"The Flight Inspiration Search API provides a list of destinations from a given airport that is ordered by price and can be filtered by departure date or maximum price.

Learn how to get started and help your users book the perfect room at over 150,000 hotels worldwide. The three endpoints of the\u202fHotel Search API let your users search hotels by destination, compare rates and rooms and get the final price of the stay. Once a room and rate are selected, you can help them complete the reservation with the Hotel Booking API. Here\u2019s how it works. Searching Hotels The API allows you to search for hotels for a given location and time. The endpoints are designed from the perspective of a funnel; i.e. to search broadly for all hotels, narrow down to a particular hotel and eventually its unique offers. A host of parameters allow the user to filter the response as per his/her need. This API thus renders enormous capabilities to build solutions for travelers not only for the hotels space, but also complement other travel scenarios or enrich apps with hotel-related information. Search hotels by location The first endpoint /shopping/hotel-offers provides\u202fa list of available hotels in a chosen location, which is defined by a city code\u202for\u202fa set of GPS coordinates. You can customize the request with parameters like chain name, amenities, star ratings, board type and more. curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/hotel-offers?cityCode = LON The API returns a list of hotel-offers objects containing the price of the cheapest available room as well as information including the hotelId , location, address, rating, description, amenities, contact information. Information The API returns cached prices. To get real-time prices and availability for a specific hotel, you\u2019ll need to move to the second endpoint. See rates for a chosen hotel After selecting a hotel, the next step in the booking flow is to get a list the available offers. Hotel offers are various combinations of rooms, services and prices. A standard room or a studio suite? One bed or two? With breakfast and free cancellation? These are the factors that make up a hotel offer. To get a list of hotel-offers for your desired hotel, just pass the hotelId from the response of the 1st endpoint into the request to the 2nd endpoint: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/hotel-offers/by-hotel?hotelId = BGLONBGB Where BGLONBGB belongs to the hotelId returned by the first endpoint. The endpoint will return a new list of hotel-offers objects, together with a list of offers : \"offers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"Y0UE4D1MUT\" , \"checkInDate\" : \"2022-07-01\" , \"checkOutDate\" : \"2022-07-02\" , \"rateCode\" : \"PRO\" , \"rateFamilyEstimated\" : { \"code\" : \"PRO\" , \"type\" : \"P\" }, \"commission\" : { \"percentage\" : \"4.00\" }, \"boardType\" : \"ROOM_ONLY\" , \"room\" : { \"type\" : \"ROH\" , \"typeEstimated\" : { \"category\" : \"STANDARD_ROOM\" } } } Get the final price and conditions The third step is to confirm the final price and availability of the chosen offer and get the full conditions. As there are thousands of people reserving hotels at any given second, the availability of a given room may change between the moment you search and the moment you decide to book. If you don\u2019t confirm the price and availability, you may receive an error when it comes time to make the reservation. The 3rd endpoint also returns the full conditions of the offer including cancellation policy, accepted methods of payment and a complete description of what\u2019s included in the offer. curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/shopping/hotel-offers/Y0UE4D1MUT This endpoint takes the offer Id obtained in the previous step as a URL parameter. Now that you have found the offer (and its Id) you want and confirmed the price and availability, you're ready to book! Booking the Hotel The Hotel Booking API\u202fis the final step in the booking flow. By making a POST request with the offer Id returned by the Hotel Search API, the guest information and the payment information, you can create a booking directly on the hotel reservation system. curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/booking/hotel-bookings \\ --data-raw '{ \"data\": { \"offerId\": \"Y0UE4D1MUT\", \"guests\": [ { \"id\": 1, \"name\": { \"title\": \"MR\", \"firstName\": \"BOB\", \"lastName\": \"SMITH\" }, \"contact\": { \"phone\": \"+33679278416\", \"email\": \"bob.smith@email.com\" } } ], \"payments\": [ { \"id\": 1, \"method\": \"creditCard\", \"card\": { \"vendorCode\": \"VI\", \"cardNumber\": \"4151289722471370\", \"expiryDate\": \"2023-08\" } } ], \"rooms\": [ { \"guestIds\": [ 1 ], \"paymentId\": 1, \"specialRequest\": \"I will arrive at midnight\" } ] } }' Congratulations, you\u2019ve just performed your first hotel booking! Once the reservation is made, the API will return a unique booking confirmation ID which you can send to your users. Notes about Payment The Hotel Search API returns information about the payment policy of each hotel. The main policy types are: Guarantee: the hotel will save credit card information during booking but not make any charge to the account. In the case of a no-show or out-of-policy cancellation, the hotel may charge penalties to the card. Deposit: at the time or booking or on a given deadline, the hotel will charge the guest a percentage of the total amount of the reservation. The remaining amount is paid by the traveler directly at the hotel. Prepay: the total amount of the reservation must be paid by the traveler during booking. The current version of the Hotel Booking API only permits booking at hotels that accept credit cards. During the booking process, Amadeus passes the payment and guest information to the hotel but does not validate information. Be sure to validate the payment and guest information, as invalid information may result in the reservation being cancelled. As soon as your application stores, transmits, or processes cardholder information, you will need to comply with\u202fPCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For more information, visit the PCI Security Council website . Getting Hotel Ratings Amadeus Hotel Ratings API returns a rating for many of the crucial elements of a hotel\u2019s offer; whether that be sleep quality, services, facilities, room comforts, value for money, location and many other variables. Hotel Ratings API guarantees high-quality service for your customers. The sentiment analysis, just like the one below, is displayed in a simple flow to allow you to easily identify the best hotels based on traveler reviews: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v2/e-reputation/hotel-sentiments?hotelIds = TELONMFS,ADNYCCTB,XXXYYY01 { \"data\" : [ { \"type\" : \"hotelSentiment\" , \"numberOfReviews\" : 218 , \"numberOfRatings\" : 278 , \"hotelId\" : \"ADNYCCTB\" , \"overallRating\" : 93 , \"sentiments\" : { \"sleepQuality\" : 87 , \"service\" : 98 , \"facilities\" : 90 , \"roomComforts\" : 92 , \"valueForMoney\" : 87 , \"catering\" : 89 , \"location\" : 98 , \"pointsOfInterest\" : 91 , \"staff\" : 100 } }, { \"type\" : \"hotelSentiment\" , \"numberOfReviews\" : 2667 , \"numberOfRatings\" : 2666 , \"hotelId\" : \"TELONMFS\" , \"overallRating\" : 81 , \"sentiments\" : { \"sleepQuality\" : 78 , \"service\" : 80 , \"facilities\" : 75 , \"roomComforts\" : 87 , \"valueForMoney\" : 75 , \"catering\" : 81 , \"location\" : 89 , \"internet\" : 72 , \"pointsOfInterest\" : 81 , \"staff\" : 89 } } ] With these additional filters, your booking process is made more efficient and you can offer your customers an enriched shopping experience, confident that you are offering a hotel choice that is rated highly in the areas that customers most appreciate. Common Errors AcceptedPayments must be creditCards The current version of the Hotel Booking API only supports credit card payments, which are accepted by most hotels.

Using this API, you can automatically suggest airports based on what the traveler enters in the search field. The API provides a list of airports/cities ordered by yearly passenger volume with the name, 3-letter IATA code, time zone and coordinates of each airport. Airport Nearest Relevant The Airport Nearest Relevant API finds the closest major airports to a starting point. The API provides a list of commercial airports within a 500km (311mi) radius of a given point that are ordered by relevance, which considers their distance from the starting point and their yearly flight traffic. For each airport, the API provides the name, 3-letter IATA code, time zone and coordinates. Points of Interest The Points of Interest API relies on AVUXI\u2019s GeoPopularity algorithm, which analyses and ranks geolocated data from more than 60 sources, including comments, photos, and reviews from millions of users. Points of Interest by radius The first endpoint supports only GET method and returns a list of points of interest for a given location - latitude and longitude - and a radius (1 km by default). The following sample returns a list of POIs for someone geolocated in Barcelona downtown: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/ locations/pois?latitude = 41 .397158 & longitude = 2 .160873 In case we want to expand the area of search, we could use the radius parameter. In the following example, we increase the radius up to 3 kilometers: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois?latitude = 41 .397158 & longitude = 2 .160873 & radius = 3 Points of Interest by a square The second endpoint works in a similar way to the radius-based endpoint: It supports also GET operations but it defines the area of search with a box: north, west, south, and east. The following example returns a list of points of interest for an area around Barcelona: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/locations/pois/by-square?north = 41 .397158 & west = 2 .160873 & south = 41 .394582 & east = 2 .177181 Response For both endpoints you can expect the same response format: a list of locations with the following JSON structure: { \"type\" : \"location\" , \"subType\" : \"POINT_OF_INTEREST\" , \"geoCode\" : { \"latitude\" : 41.39165 , \"longitude\" : 2.164772 }, \"name\" : \"Casa Batll\u00f3\" , \"category\" : \"SIGHTS\" , \"tags\" : [ \"sightseeing\" , \"museum\" , \"sights\" , \"landmark\" ] } Where: Type and subType are literals with fixed values. geoCode is a structure which contains geolocation information: latitude and longitude of the location. name contains the string identifying the location. category corresponds to the category of the location and could be one of the following values: SIGHTS, BEACH_PARK, HISTORICAL, NIGHTLIFE, RESTAURANT or SHOPPING. tags field is a list of words related to that location which comes directly from the different sources of data analyzed. Safe Rates The Safe Place API is the newest addition to our Self-Service API catalog. Created in partnership with GeoSure, the global leader in scaled location safety ratings, the API is powered by GeoSafeScores\u2122 algorithm which provides safety and security ratings for over 65,000 cities and neighborhoods worldwide. Safe Places by radius This endpoint returns the overall safety rating of the targeted location defined by latitude, longitude and a radius. It\u2019s very useful when you want to retrieve safety information for a downtown area, or around a specific point like a hotel, market or crowed touristic attraction. For example, the following request retrieves the safety scores around the famous Sagrada Family in Barcelona: curl https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/safety/safety-rated-locations?latitude = 41 .403749 & longitude = 2 .174387 Note that you don\u2019t have to specify the radius \u2013 it is an optional query parameter set to 1 km by default.

OpenJDK? Oracle JDK? help! Despite the complexity of the Java ecosystem, it's important to understand that there is only one set of source code for the JDK released under GPL license and hosted at OpenJDK . You can always follow these instructions to compile and generate your own JDK flavor. Different vendors build the OpenJDK adding additional tools, utilities or branding elements, but never modifying the language. As result the vendor provides a new build with some unique vendor capabilities or certification processes. There are many JDK implementations out there, but the most used ones are: OpenJDK . Oracle GPL license unbranded builds of the OpenJDK. Oracle JDK . Branded builds from Oracle that could be used without cost. There are more implementations like Zulu , IBM JDK , Red Hat or AdoptOpenJDK . If you want to switch seamessly between flavors and versions, we recommend you to take a look to the sdkman tool. Installation The SDK can be installed by adding a Gradle dependency or Maven dependency, or by cloning the source into a project. Additionally it can be installed by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the releases page on GitHub . Maven <dependency> <groupId> com.amadeus </groupId> <artifactId> amadeus-java </artifactId> <version> 3.3.0 </version> </dependency> Gradle compile \"com.amadeus:amadeus-java:3.3.0\" Setting up the environment Java JDK Installation Linux / Windows Go to AdoptOpenJDK website and download the tarball (Version 8 at the time of writting this). Make sure the new Java installation is the default Java in your system: Extract the .tar.gz . Add bin directory to your PATH environment. Export a new JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to the directory where Java has been installed. Check that Java has installed correctly java -version Information On Linux, use update-alternatives --config java whenever is possible. macOS We recommend to use brew if possible. If you haven't installed brew already install it! Then install Java as follows: brew cask uninstall java brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk brew cask install adoptopenjdk8 Gradle Managing a Java project and its dependencies manually could be an exhausting task if you don't use the proper tools or IDEs (Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ...). This tutorial is meant to be followed using command line. This will give us a better understanding about what's going on beneath any IDE. There are several tools which makes us life eaiser. The most interesting ones are Gradle and maven . Although our Java SDK supports both Gradle and maven , for our example we are going to use Gradle . Let's see how it works. Installation Go ahead and install Gradle following the instructions from the website. Make sure the gradle tool belongs to your PATH variable. To test the Gradle installation, run gradle from the command line: gradle Welcome to Gradle 4.10.2! Here are the highlights of this release: - Incremental Java compilation by default - Periodic Gradle caches cleanup - Gradle Kotlin DSL 1.0-RC6 - Nested included builds - SNAPSHOT plugin versions in the `plugins {}` block For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/4.10.2/release-notes.html Step-by-step example This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a simple Java application which calls the Flight Inspiration Search API using the Amadeus for Developers Java SDK Using the Amadeus Java SDK For this tutorial we will use Unix-based commands. Windows has similar commands for each. The requirements to follow this tutorial are the following: Your favorite editor Java correctly installed (see previous section) gradle Amadeus for Developers API key Let's do something cool by calling one of our Flight Search APIs from your Java code. Let's start by creating a new folder AmadeusTest on your $HOME directory. Switch to this new folder and create a subdirectory structure that will host our project: mkdir -p src/main/java/flightsearch Create a new file called FlightSearch.java inside src/main/java/flightsearch with the following content: package flightsearch ; public class FlightSearch { public static void main ( String [] args ) { System . out . println ( \"Hello World\" ); } } Go back to the root folder AmadeusTest and initialize your project using gradle : gradle init You'll notice a few new files in your root folder. You can freely add them to your version control system so everyone can build it just the same way. Edit the build.gradle file with your favorite editor and add: apply plugin : ' java ' apply plugin : ' application ' mainClassName = ' flightsearch . FlightSearch ' Note that mainClassName must be fully qualified class name. Let's build and run the source using the gradlew wrapper script that Gradle has just created: ./gradlew run > Task :run Hello World BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s 2 actionable tasks: 2 executed The run argument is a task. Each project includes a collection of tasks, each of which performs a basic operation. Gradle comes with a set of predefined tasks that could be extended using an API. Managing tasks is out of the scope of this tutorial, but you can find more information about how to extend and configure tasks on Gradle documentation . Information Note that a new folder build/libs has been created containing the jar file of your project. Now that we have our skeleton ready, let's extend it to implement a call to the Flight Inspiration Search API . According to the Java SDK documentation, we need to update our build.gradle file to include the following dependencies: compile ' com . google . code . gson : gson : 2.8.5 ' compile \"com.amadeus:amadeus-java:3.3.0\" Our build.gradle will look like: apply plugin : ' java ' apply plugin : ' application ' sourceCompatibility = 1.8 targetCompatibility = 1.8 dependencies { compile ' com . google . code . gson : gson : 2.8.5 ' compile ' com . amadeus : amadeus - java : 3.3.0 ' } repositories { maven { url \"https://jcenter.bintray.com\" } } jar { baseName = ' flightSearch ' version = ' 0.1.0 ' } mainClassName = ' flightsearch . FlightSearch ' Note that we have added repositories section in order to retrieve the jar files automatically during the build task. It's time to call the APIs from our Java sample! Edit the FlightSearch.java file and add the necessary imports: import com.amadeus.Amadeus ; import com.amadeus.Params ; import com.amadeus.exceptions.ResponseException ; import com.amadeus.shopping.FlightDestinations ; import com.amadeus.resources.FlightDestination ; Add the SDK initialization right after the main class replacing \" CLIENT_ID \" and \" CLIENT_SECRET \" with the real values of your client id and client secret : Amadeus amadeus = Amadeus . builder ( \"CLIENT_ID\" , \"CLIENT_SECRET\" ) . build (); Finally call the API and print out the first result of the . This call will retrieve the best offers departuring from Madrid as of today. See how the get method of flightDestinations object returns a list of FlightDestination objects: FlightDestination [] flightDestinations = amadeus . shopping . flightDestinations . get ( Params . with ( \"origin\" , \"MAD\" ) ); The complete sample file looks like this: import com.amadeus.Amadeus ; import com.amadeus.Params ; import com.amadeus.exceptions.ResponseException ; import com.amadeus.shopping.FlightDestinations ; import com.amadeus.resources.FlightDestination ; public class FlightSearch { public static void main ( String [] args ) throws ResponseException { Amadeus amadeus = Amadeus . builder ( \"CLIENT_ID\" , \"CLIENT_SECRET\" ) . build (); FlightDestination [] flightDestinations = amadeus . shopping . flightDestinations . get ( Params . with ( \"origin\" , \"MAD\" )); if ( flightDestinations [ 0 ] . getResponse (). getStatusCode () != 200 ) { System . out . println ( \"Wrong status code for Flight Inspiration Search: \" + flightDestinations [ 0 ] . getResponse (). getStatusCode ()); System . exit ( - 1 ); } System . out . println ( flightDestinations [ 0 ] ); } } Let's build and run the code to see that everything is working properly (the output has been splitted into different lines for clarity): ./gradlew run > Task :run FlightDestination ( type = flight-destination, origin = MAD, destination = BIO, departureDate = Sat Nov 17 00 :00:00 CET 2018 , returnDate = Wed Nov 21 00 :00:00 CET 2018 , price = FlightDestination.Price ( total = 92 .26 ))","title":"Java SDK"},{"location":"sdks/java-sdk/#java-sdk","text":"Java usually refers to the programming language but also to the platform: a set of tools -virtual machine, compiler and libraries- which allow developers to create cross-platform applications.","title":"Java SDK"},{"location":"sdks/java-sdk/#openjdk-oracle-jdk-help","text":"Despite the complexity of the Java ecosystem, it's important to understand that there is only one set of source code for the JDK released under GPL license and hosted at OpenJDK .
